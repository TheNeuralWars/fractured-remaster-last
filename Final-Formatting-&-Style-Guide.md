# Final Formatting & Style Guide
## "The Neural Wars: Fractured Code" - Definitive Markdown Standards

*Comprehensive formatting guide including scene tags, dialogue conventions, section breaks, hooks, key term emphasis, and layout rules with annotated examples and rationale.*

---

## **Chapter Structure & Headers**

### **Chapter Titles**
**Format**: `# [Number]: [THEMATIC TITLE]`

**Examples:**
- `# 1: THRESHOLD`
- `# 3: FRACTURE`  
- `# EPILOGUE`

**Rationale**: Single-word thematic titles create emotional impact and thematic cohesion. Numbers maintain structural clarity while themes suggest psychological journey.

### **Section Breaks within Chapters**
**Format**: `---` (three em-dashes)

**Usage**: Separates major scene transitions, time jumps, or perspective shifts within the same chapter.

**Example**:
```markdown
Mileo traces one with his fingertip, feeling nothing but the chill radiating through the glass.

---

[Memory]

*A small boy stands on tiptoes, reaching for a jar of colored pencils.*
```

**Rationale**: Clean visual separation maintains readability while allowing smooth narrative flow between related scenes.

---

## **Scene Tags & Atmospheric Markers**

### **Scene Tag Format**
**Format**: `[Tag][Additional Tags]`

**Placement**: Immediately following chapter header or section break

**Core Tag Categories:**
- **[Reflection]**: Internal character exploration, contemplative scenes
- **[Action]**: Kinetic sequences, physical confrontation, urgency
- **[Street]**: Resistance/Slums settings, underground atmosphere
- **[Memory]**: Flashback sequences, recovered experiences
- **[Cosmic]**: Architect perspective, vast consciousness, otherworldly elements

**Example Applications:**
```markdown
[Reflection]
Rain draws lines down the window—each droplet too perfect...

[Action][Street]
The stench hits Kora first—acrid sweat, machine oil...

[Cosmic][Perception]
Within the interdimensional space where physical reality intersects...
```

**Rationale**: Tags provide immediate atmospheric orientation for readers while maintaining manuscript organization. Multiple tags allow layered scene complexity.

### **Tag Hierarchy & Combinations**
**Primary Tags** (Atmosphere): [Reflection], [Action], [Street], [Memory], [Cosmic]
**Secondary Tags** (Specificity): [Perception], [Discovery], [Investigation], [Confrontation]

**Combination Rules:**
- Maximum two tags per scene
- Primary tag always first
- Tags separated without spaces: `[Action][Street]`

## **Dialogue Formatting**

### **Standard Dialogue Attribution**
**Format**: Em-dash prefix with attribution and action integration

**Standard Pattern:**
```markdown
—Good morning, Mileo, chimes the apartment's ambient system, its voice modulated to harmonics that synchronize with his neural interface.
```

**Key Conventions:**
- **Em-dash** (—) not hyphen (-) for dialogue
- **Lowercase** after dialogue unless proper noun
- **Action beats** integrated with attribution for rhythm

### **Interrupted Dialogue**
**Format**: Em-dash at interruption point

**Examples:**
```markdown
—Thank— The word executes from his vocal apparatus before he can inhibit the response protocol.

—Probability calculations showing increased risk factors, he mutters... —Patrol convergence mathematical models indicate—
—Math later, Sierra cuts him off
```

**Rationale**: Shows technological hijacking of speech, stress responses, and character dynamics through interruption patterns.

### **Internal Dialogue vs. Spoken Dialogue**
**Internal Thoughts**: *Italics* with or without attribution
**Subvocal Communication**: Standard em-dash with technical attribution

**Examples:**
```markdown
*Something is wrong with the rain.*

—Target? she subvocalizes, jaw barely moving, the words trapped between her teeth.
```

### **System/AI Dialogue**
**Format**: Standard em-dash with technical system attribution

**Examples:**
```markdown
—Your biometrics indicate mild sleep inefficiency, the ambient system reminds him. —Would you like me to adjust your circadian regulation protocol?
```

**Rationale**: Maintains consistency while allowing technical language to suggest non-human source.

---

## **Emphasis & Typography**

### **Key Term Emphasis**
**Technical Terms**: Normal formatting, context provides emphasis
**Consciousness Thoughts**: *Italics*
**System Designations**: Normal formatting with capitalization
**Emotional Emphasis**: *Italics* sparingly

**Examples:**
- Neural Compliance Specialist (technical role)
- *Interface integrity compromised* (authentic thought breaking through)
- The Architect (system designation)
- *wrong* (emotional emphasis)

**Rationale**: Overuse of formatting diminishes impact. Context and word choice create emphasis more effectively than typography.

### **Scientific/Technical Precision**
**Format**: Exact measurements and percentages maintain scientific credibility

**Examples:**
- "precisely seven millimeters apart"
- "0.0027% occurrence rate among Specialists"  
- "1.2-meter distances"
- "exactly 15 degrees"

**Rationale**: Precision emphasizes optimization's mathematical control while creating uncanny valley effect.

### **Sensory Detail Integration**
**Format**: Specific, measured descriptions that engage multiple senses

**Pattern**: **Primary sense** → **Secondary sense** → **Emotional/thematic connection**

**Example**:
```markdown
The stench hits Kora first—acrid sweat, machine oil, bodies pressed too close together. But beneath that, something else: copper and ozone, warm bread, spilled moonshine. The smells of defiance.
```

**Rationale**: Sensory layering creates immersion while building toward thematic significance.

---

## **Paragraph Structure & Flow**

### **Standard Paragraph Architecture**
**Pattern**: **Medium opening** → **Complex development** → **Short impact**

**Example**:
```markdown
Mileo sits alone in the angular shadow of a ventilation duct, fingers tracing the raised scars on his forearm. The implants pulse with faint indigo bioluminescence beneath his skin—a neural network of pain etched into flesh, data storage made physical, memory carved into meat. Evidence that cannot be optimized away.
```

**Rationale**: Musical pacing creates rhythm and emotional build toward impactful conclusions.

### **Action Sequence Pacing**
**Format**: **Short, punchy sentences** with **present-tense immediacy**

**Example**:
```markdown
Sierra's hand drops to her pulse weapon. Her heartbeat slows to 62 BPM—combat rhythm engaging without conscious thought. Her vision narrows, peripheral details fading as her brain prioritizes threat assessment.
```

**Rationale**: Shorter sentences create urgency and mirror rapid thought processes during crisis.

### **Contemplative Sequence Pacing**
**Format**: **Longer, complex sentences** with **sensory and emotional depth**

**Example**:
```markdown
Rain draws lines down the window—each droplet too perfect, marching in lockstep, precisely seven millimeters apart. Mileo traces one with his fingertip, feeling nothing but the chill radiating through the glass.
```

**Rationale**: Longer sentences allow detailed observation and internal processing, matching contemplative psychological state.

---

## **Memory & Flashback Formatting**

### **Memory Sequence Structure**
**Format**: 
- **Trigger**: Present-moment catalyst
- **Transition**: `---` section break
- **Memory Content**: *Italics* with present tense
- **Return**: Explicit connection to present

**Example**:
```markdown
His teeth clench as he forces the memory through.

---

[Memory]

*A small boy stands on tiptoes, reaching for a jar of colored pencils. Green, blue, red—forbidden pigments, unpredictable and bright.*

*—Quick, she whispers. —Before they test the building again.*

*The memory flickers—a moment from before the Link, before optimization.*

---

[Reflection]

His jaw muscles contract involuntarily.
```

**Rationale**: Clear formatting prevents confusion while maintaining emotional continuity between past and present.

### **Fragmentary Memory Format**
**Format**: *Italics* integrated within paragraph, often incomplete

**Example**:
```markdown
*Subject exhibits total memory suppression regarding offspring Marcus Chen, recalibrated 47 days ago.*
```

**Rationale**: Shows damaged neural pathways and partial information recovery realistic to Link extraction process.

---

## **World-Building Integration**

### **Technical Exposition Balance**
**Format**: Information embedded in **character perception** and **action context**

**Effective Pattern**:
```markdown
His specialist training allows him to identify the symptoms: microscopic ruptures in Link integration pathways, quantum resonance anomalies in the interface connections. Statistically improbable—0.0027% occurrence rate among Specialists—yet occurring.
```

**Avoid**: Pure exposition dumps without character filter

**Rationale**: Character expertise provides natural context for technical information while maintaining narrative momentum.

### **Environmental Description Protocol**
**Format**: **Specific measurements** + **Sensory details** + **Character reaction**

**Example**:
```markdown
Outside, Neo-Citania gleams in morning light—white spires rising at perfect angles, their surfaces reflecting the mauve-pink sunrise in mathematical patterns. Citizens move along designated paths, maintaining precisely 1.2-meter distances, their clothing in approved color spectra of regulation grays and blues.

*System parameters exceed statistical probability thresholds for natural occurrence.*
```

**Rationale**: Combines world-building with character perception and internal response, maintaining engagement while revealing systematic control.

---

## **Hook & Transition Techniques**

### **Chapter Opening Hooks**
**Format**: **Immediate sensory engagement** or **internal conflict**

**Effective Examples**:
- "Rain draws lines down the window—each droplet too perfect"
- "The stench hits Kora first—acrid sweat, machine oil"
- "In the quantum substrate where conventional physics yields to consciousness architecture"

**Pattern**: **Specific detail** → **Character response** → **World implication**

### **Chapter Ending Hooks**
**Format**: **Revelation**, **threat escalation**, or **emotional climax**

**Examples**:
- "Something called the Renaissance Protocol."
- "Harvesting begins."
- "The invitation approaches. The threshold awaits."

**Rationale**: Forward momentum maintains reader engagement across chapter breaks.

### **Scene Transition Techniques**
**Smooth Transitions**: Emotional or thematic bridges between scenes
**Jump Cuts**: Sharp contrast for dramatic effect
**Echo Transitions**: Repeated phrases or images across scene breaks

**Example Echo Transition**:
```markdown
She forces her hand down, jaw muscles bunching. Old habits persist like ghosts.

---

[Street]

The resistance council chamber bristles with tension—not the artificial calm of optimized sectors but something raw and electric.
```

**Rationale**: "Ghosts" echoes into new scene's "raw" authenticity, connecting themes across location change.

---

## **Consistency Protocols**

### **Character Name Usage**
**First Reference**: Full name with role/designation
**Subsequent References**: First name or role as appropriate
**POV Character**: Often unnamed in their own sections

**Example Progression**:
1. "Mileo Chen, Neural Compliance Specialist"
2. "Mileo" (subsequent references)
3. Direct experience without name in his POV sections

### **Technical Term Consistency**
**Established Terms**: Maintain exact spelling and capitalization
**New Terms**: Introduce with context, then use consistently

**Key Terms Requiring Consistency**:
- The Architect (always capitalized)
- Link, the Link (specific capitalization)
- NeuroSys (compound word, specific capitalization)
- Neo-Citania (hyphenated)
- Fractured, the Fractured (resistance designation)

### **Measurement & Time Precision**
**Format**: Specific numbers create optimization atmosphere
**Consistency**: Use metric system throughout
**Precision Level**: Measurements to 1-2 decimal places maximum

**Examples**:
- "precisely seven millimeters apart"
- "0.0027% occurrence rate"
- "1.2-meter distances"

---

## **Proofreading & Quality Control**

### **Common Error Prevention**
- **Em-dashes** (—) not hyphens (-) for dialogue
- **Italics** properly closed for internal thoughts
- **Capitalization** consistent for world-specific terms
- **Scene tags** in proper format and placement

### **Final Review Checklist**
- [ ] All dialogue uses em-dashes
- [ ] Scene tags properly formatted and positioned  
- [ ] Internal thoughts in italics
- [ ] Technical terms consistently capitalized
- [ ] Paragraph pacing varies appropriately
- [ ] Sensory details engage multiple senses
